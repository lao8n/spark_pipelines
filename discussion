Idea is pass around a struct of dimension values that are updated by functions.
Each function can take a struct and based upon which dimension the arrays are on it performs the appropriate
dimension change.

MVP = Take a df of one column with dimensions row_wise = x, col_wise = 1, and apply groupby_agg(df, x) to get
row_wise = x_unique, col_wise = 1
